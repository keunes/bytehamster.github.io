      "content"  : "Central and distributed podcast appsThere are basically two ways how to make a podcast app:  Central: There is a central server (run by the company that develops the app) that checks for new episodes and then delivers them to you.  Distributed: The app itself checks new episodes, directly from the podcast publishers.AntennaPod uses method 2, eg. we do not have a central server. There are a few advantages and disadvantages about that method.  Using the central method, if the company shuts down their server for whatever reason, the app will stop to work. AntennaPod will continue to work independently from what we do on our end because the app only looks at the podcast publisher’s websites to collect new episodes.  Using the central method, the company must operate the server, which costs money. Therefore, apps that use that approach are either paid or show ads. AntennaPod is developed by volunteers without making any money from it. The app is free and without advertisements but we can therefore not afford operating a server.  Using the central method, the server operator knows what podcasts you are subscribed to. They probably even know what episodes you listen to, what parts of the episodes and at what time you listen. AntennaPod does not know anything about that. We do not even have a server where we could collect that data.  If you listen to private feeds (some publishers sell their podcasts or give supporters early access to the episodes), the central method requires to send your password to the company running the app. Usually, the central services simply do not allow to add private feeds.  Using the central approach, the company running the app can keep episodes on their server even if they are deleted by the podcast publishers. Using the distributed approach, you can only access the episodes that the publishers specify in their feed. If you subscribe to a podcast using AntennaPod and the publisher deletes an episode, the app will keep the episode, too, but if you delete and re-install the app, it is gone (unless you make a backup). Everything happens locally on your device, so if the publishers do not list an episode, the distributed approach can not know that it exists.  Using the distributed approach, you can listen to all podcasts. Because your device itself looks for new episodes, app developers can not really censor what you can listen to by removing podcasts from their server."

      "content"  : "How to synchronize between devicesFor synchronization, AntennaPod uses the free service gpodder.net. In order to synchronize your clients, you need to create an account there.  After you created the account, we suggest to create a device on gpodder.net/devices/ for each client that you use:  After you created the devices, link them using the “Configure” button. This way, gpodder.net automatically keeps the subscriptions of both devices synchronized.  Then, have a look at AntennaPod’s Settings » Synchronization). There you can log in to gpodder.net or even provide an alternative server if you want to host it yourself. During login, AntennaPod asks what device you are currently logged into. Select your newly created device.You can also create a new device while logging in and link it later. The disadvantage of this is that only podcasts that were added after linking the devices are synchronized. Therefore, in order to get all your existing subscriptions synchronized, you need to create and link the devices before logging in (like it is described in this post). There is an open issue for gpodder.net that requests to change the behavior but for now, linking needs to be done before synchronizing.  Enjoy synchronization :)Old AntennaPod versions only upload the “played” state of episodes after signing in, so your old played episodes are not marked as played on the other client. This is changed in AntennaPod 2.0.0: there, you can press the Force sync button to also upload the played state of all episodes listened to earlier. AntennaPod 2.0.0 is not officially released yet but you can just press the Force sync button after it was released."

Importing RSS or Atom feeds, or URL schemes like pcast:// and itpc://, will also work.Subscribing to third-party servicesWe got some questions about support for platforms like Soundcloud, Mixcloud and alike. While it may be cool to have a feature to simply paste/open channel URLs in AntennaPod, it’s been decided to not implement it. Such platforms may come and disappear, while it’s quite some work for our volunteers to implement this feature. If you’re a developer, you’re of course welcome to discuss a proposal that you’d be happy to implement.SoundcloudSoundcloud allows producers to create podcasts from their content pretty easily. You should reach out to them, share the SoundCloud help page (linked just before), and ask if they’re willing to set it up.MixcloudMixcloud unfortunately doesn’t offer this option for content creators. As always, there’s someone in the podcasting community to come up with a solution. You should check out the options as laid out in this post.YouTubeYouTube allows you subscribe to a channel’s feed, but:  AntennaPod cannot automatically download the videos, as YouTube doesn’t allow that. Showing ads is their business model, after all.  You won’t have an image connected to your subscription, as YouTube doesn’t include it in the feeds.But it is a way to get notified about new episodes. Just add the URL of the user/channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/USERNAME or https://www.youtube.com/channel/CHANNEL_ID) in AntennaPod. You should be presented with an dialog with the option ‘RSS’; tap to add the feed. If that doesn’t work as described, add https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=&lt;CHANNEL_ID&gt; to AntennaPod. You can find the channel id in the URL of the channel. If the channel you want to subscribe to is a user account (with a URL like youtube.com/user/UserName), you can contact the user to ask for their channel id (here it’s explained how users can find their channel id).We don’t have any information on other platforms, as you can see.
